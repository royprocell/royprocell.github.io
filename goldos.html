		<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px">
		GoldOS is a x86 16 bit operating system project that started in 2013.
		There have been three iterations of GoldOS that I've made, with each iteration having cleaner code and new features.
		GoldOS is written entirely in Assembly and utilizes the FAT16 filesystem.
		This project helped me learn about the booting process of a computer as well as how an operating system works.
		This project also gave me the opportunity to learn Assembly and closely examine how software interacts with hardware at the lowest level.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		In December 2015, I created a Github Repository for my latest iteration of GoldOS which started in July 2015.
